   - Node version: 18.x

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@your-rds-endpoint:5432/jharkhand_civic_reporting
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-32-characters-minimum
   NODE_ENV=production
   NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST_URL=https://your-app-id.amplifyapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL=https://your-app-id.amplifyapp.com/uploads
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Save and deploy"
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Test the application

### 4. Database Setup
1. **Run Migrations**

   ```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Application Testing
- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] User registration/login works
- [ ] Complaint submission works
- [ ] File uploads work
- [ ] Admin dashboard accessible
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly

### 2. Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load times are acceptable
- [ ] Images load properly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works
- [ ] No console errors

### 3. Security Testing
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Security headers are present
- [ ] Authentication works properly
- [ ] File uploads are secure

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node.js version (should be 18.x)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript errors

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Check RDS security groups
   - Ensure database is accessible

3. **Environment Variable Issues**
   - Verify all required variables are set
   - Check variable names and values
   - Restart the application after changes

4. **File Upload Issues**
   - Check NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL
   - Verify file permissions
   - Check file size limits

### Monitoring

1. **AWS Amplify Console**
   - Monitor build logs
   - Check deployment status
   - View application metrics

2. **Application Logs**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Monitor network requests
   - Verify API responses

## üìä Performance Optimization

### 1. Image Optimization
- Images are automatically optimized to WebP/AVIF
- Lazy loading is enabled
- Responsive images are generated

### 2. Caching
- Static assets are cached
- API responses are cached appropriately
- CDN is used for global distribution

### 3. Bundle Size
- Code splitting is enabled
- Unused code is eliminated
- Dependencies are optimized

## üîí Security Considerations

### 1. Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive data to Git
- Use AWS Amplify environment variables
- Rotate secrets regularly

### 2. Database Security
- Use strong passwords
- Enable SSL connections
- Restrict access to necessary IPs only

### 3. Application Security
- JWT tokens are secure
- Input validation is in place
- File uploads are restricted

## üìà Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Regular Checks
